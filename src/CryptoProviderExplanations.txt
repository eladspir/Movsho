
The following providers were used :

1) SunJCE contains valuable features such as "AES", "JCEKS", "RSA".
The first is used for encrypting the raw data in blocks. 
The second is for handling the KeyStore.
The third is used for asymmetric encrypting of the secret key. 

2) SUN contains SHA1PRNG for generating the pseudo-random Initialization Vector. 

3) SunRsaSign contains SHA1withRSA algorithm that was needed encrypt and hash the signature.
